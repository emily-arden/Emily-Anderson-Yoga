    <h1>About Emily</h1>

    <p>
        Emily is from the UK and moved to DC in 2018, when her husband got a job in the area.  Before her move, Emily had used yoga as a way to deal with anxiety and stress while working as a lawyer in both London and Singapore.  Upon realizing these benefits, Emily became more and more curious about the history and benefits of yoga, which culminated in her taking her 200 hour teacher training with Yoga District in 2019.  Emily continues to learn and is dedicated to sharing the benefits of yoga with others.

    <p>Outside of yoga, Emily is currently pursuing her MBA.  You may also find her walking DC dogs, reading in one of Georgetown's coffee shops, or trying her best at dance classes.
